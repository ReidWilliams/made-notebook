Thanksgiving was just the three of us, so we ditched turkey and made other things. Mary made a brisket and I made a couple of dishes from the Relæ cookbook, picking ones that were kind of like Thanksgiving sides.

In this one, I dehydrated turnips, then rehydrated and boiled to make it like an al dente pasta. The sauce was an emulsified butter sauce, thickened with xantham, with parsley (which I subbed for the chervil) and horseradish. 

It was intense and peppery, but worth making again, though it's the kind of dish you just want a small plate of. 

Dehydrating then rehydrating turnips to make a faux pasta is a good technique and worth repeating.
