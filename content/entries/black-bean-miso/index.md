This is adapted from the Noma peaso recipe, using black beans instead of yellow peas. If it turns out well, it'll make a good bean & cheese burrito.

- 1 lb (454 g) dried Rancho Gordo black beans, ~1000 g after cooking 
- 592 g koji, a mixture of Amazake co and Miyako 
- 258 g water
- 74 g (4%) salt

I found that I needed to add the extra water, likely because I'm using dried koji rather than freash koji as in the book.

I used clean equipment and washed hands, but didn't worry much about sanitizing or wearing gloves.

I packed the miso into a 6 quart plastic food bucket.
