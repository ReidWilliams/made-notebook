**80% hydration, 10% whole wheat**

#### Day 1
Night, dilute starter 1 in 5 to start exponential growth. Same next morning.

#### Day 2
Night, dilute starter 1 in 11 into 100g whole wheat flour + 100g water. This makes just enough for recipe, so separately dilute starter for storage.

#### Day 3
Mix:
- 750g water at 100°F
- 100g whole wheat flour
- 900g bread flour

Autolyse 1-2 hours covered. Keep temperature at 80° F so that levain goes into dough at 80°. Check levain with float test, then add and mix:
- 200g levain
- 20g salt
- 50g water at 100°F

Bulk ferment ~5 hours at 80°F internal temperature. Stretch and fold every 60 minutes.


Divide, shape, bench rest for 30 minutes, shape, in bowls.
Proof at RT for 60-90 mins, in fridge overnight.

#### Day 4
Preheat oven to 550°F (regular bake mode), reduce to 450°F. Bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered for 20-30 minutes. Single cut for score gives taller loaf.
