Using [recipe v.1](/entries/bread-recipe-v.1).

Started autolyse at 9:30am with 25% whole wheat, 75% Giusto’s ultimate performer bread flour, 800 g water. Final hydration was 90%

Mix ended at 1:45pm (so about 4 hours autolyse). I want bulk to take longer today, so using 150g levain instead of 200g and leaving bulk at RT without using oven. Dough temp is around 75°F.

I Lost track of time, so first stretch and fold at 3pm, then 3:30pm, 4:30pm. Preshape at 7:15pm. Dough is a bit unstructured so gave it a long bench rest, to 8pm. Started shaping and in bannetons at 8:15pm.

Proofed at RT until 11:50pm, then in fridge.
