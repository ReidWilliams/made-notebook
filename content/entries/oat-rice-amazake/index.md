- 90 g koji
- 90 g instant oats
- 360 g water at 140°F

11pm, combined above in a glass jar and stirred, then put in a water bath in the instant pot set to 140°F. I loosely put a lid on the jar.

Next morning blended to smooth and mixed with a little half and half. I found that its best as a drink when diluted with hot water.
