[Recipe v.1](/entries/bread-recipe-v.1) with 25% whole wheat. WW flour is King Author’s “white whole wheat” which is from white instead of red wheat. The scale got messed up while measuring water so I don’t know the hydration level but I’m guessing it’s somewhere +/- 100%.

Added 250 g toasted white sesame seeds. The seeds seemed to soak up water and made the dough feel less hydrated. Either that or dough was moving really fast in the bulk phase and strengthened quickly.

Kept dough around 82°F because I got a late start, and this definitely seemed to speed things up.

90 minute autolyse, about 4 hour bulk. In bannetons at RT around 9pm.
