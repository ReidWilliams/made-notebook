- [Recipe v.1](/entries/bread-recipe-v.1) with 25% King Arthur whole wheat, 75% Giusto’s ultimate performer (13 - 14.5% protein). The Giusto’s soaks up a lot more water than King Arthur bread flour.
- 85% hydration, and still very workable.
- Started autolyse at 11:30am
- Mixed 5 mins, finished at 1:30pm. 80°F.
- 3 or so folds every 30 mins
- Preshaped at 4:55pm. Dough developed faster than in the past, I think because I started the overnight earlier: 1 in 11 around 9pm instead of 11pm per usual.
- In bannetons at 5:30pm. Dough was easy to shape, so not maxed out on hydration with this flour.
- In fridge at 8:30pm. Very jiggly and risen, but I’m not sure its passing the poke test.
- First loaf in oven at 9:30am next day.
