The idea for this drink came from a shampoo that smelled of lime and salt‚Äîlike a margarita but with no trace of sweetness. I wondered what a dry margarita might taste like and decided that a martini should be the starting point in making what became this drink.

## Final Version

- 1 oz Mayalen Wild Cupreata Mezcal
- 1/2 oz Russell Henry London Dry Gin
- 1 oz La Cigarrera Manzanilla Sherry
- 1/2 oz + 1 tsp Dolin Dry Vermouth
- 1/4 tsp Bar 40 Umami Bitters

Combine with ice and stir as with a martini. Swab a lime peel over a martini glass and serve on the peel.

## Older Versions

### v.3

Even though v.2 was good, tried this variation anyway:

- 1 oz Mayalen Wild Cupreata Mezcal
- 1/2 oz Russell Henry London Dry Gin
- 3/4 oz La Cigarrera Manzanilla Sherry
- 3/4 oz Dolin Dry Vermouth
- 1/4 tsp Bar 40 Umami Bitters

This one is a bit too sweet, too much vermouth, I think the one before with 1 oz Sherry and 1/2 Vermouth is the best.

### v.2

Used this recipe:
- 1 oz Mayalen Wild Cupreata Mezcal
- 1/2 oz Russell Henry London Dry Gin
- 1 oz La Cigarrera Manzanilla Sherry
- 1/2 oz Dolin Dry Vermouth
- 1/4 tsp Bar 40 Umami Bitters

Same deal with the lime as v.1.

This was really good and it‚Äôs possible the drink is finished. It has a nice saltiness, mezcal / tequila, and citrusy flavor. It might be a little hot, a little too much sherry. One alternative to try is less sherry and more dry vermouth, maybe 3/4 oz dry vermouth and 3/4 oz sherry.

### v.1

- 1 oz Mayalen Wild Cupreata Mezcal
- 1/2 oz Russell Henry London Dry Gin
- 1/2 oz Dolin Dry Vermouth
- 1/4 tsp Bar 40 Umami Bitters

Combine with ice and stir as with a martini. Swab a lime peel over a martini glass and serve on the peel.

#### Notes
 
It would be good to try a more citrusy gin, maybe juniperro. Try adding manzanilla sherry to give a saltiness. Might replace the vermouth or do equal parts vermouth and sherry. Probably replace the vermouth with sherry as first pass.

Next iteration to try:

- 1 oz Mayalen Wild Cupreata Mezcal
- 1/2 oz Russell Henry London Dry Gin
- 1 oz Manzanilla Sherry
- 1/4 tsp Bar 40 Umami Bitters

I‚Äôm upping the amount of sherry because I want to mute the mescal a bit but I think the balance between mezcal and gin is good.
 
 
Tried a version with 50/50 mezcal and gin but it tasted too weak, not enough Mezcal character. Tried adding a pinch of salt but it tasted salty and not clean and pure like a Martini. The drink smells enough like the ocean, slightly salty, without having to add actual salt. I think the Manzanilla will be a better way to get saltiness.
