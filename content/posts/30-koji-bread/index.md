I've been wanting to make the Koji bread from Tartine Book No. 3 for a little while now. Where did this come from? I had some Koji sitting in the freezer (probably for too long) from when I first made garum well over a year ago. This past summer, in the middle of the pandemic, I got interested in the Koji again and made some smoked rice amazake that I then made into mouse and ice cream.

I've been thinking off and on about porridge breads and Koji since then but never had a good source for Koji, since I don't really want to cross the bridge to go to Berkeley Bowl just for Koji. Then I found a place to buy it online, [amazakeco.com](https://amazakeco.com/) and here we are.

I bought some Koji for myself and Angi; she's making the same bread too this weekend.

## Notes

The recipe is my standard sourdough loaf, adapted to use koji based on the Tartine Book No. 3 koji porridge bread recipe. The Tartine recipe calls for 50% baker's percentage of koji porridge (including dry koji and water). I wanted my loaves to be their usual size, so I scaled my entire recipe down so that the total recipe weight (including the koji) is the same as my usual recipe (2,200 g including flour, water, levain).

#### Dough

| Ingredient        | Amount |
| ------------------|--------|
| White flour       | 800 g  |
| Whole wheat flour | 100 g  |
| Water             | 750 g  |
| Levain            | 180 g  |

#### Koji porridge

| Ingredient        | Amount |
| ------------------|--------|
| Koji              | 150 g  |
| Water             | 300 g  |	

I lowered the amount of water in the dough so that the total water, including water in the porridge is 1,050 g.

- RT autolyse for 3 hours with flour and 700 g water
- Started bulk at 5:30 pm
- Folded at 30 mins, 60 mins, and hourly after that
- Boiled koji in water for about 10 or so minutes. Eventually the koji absorbed the water like when making rice.
- Cooled the koji porridge and folded into the dough at 1 hour.
- Ended bulk around 10 p
- 90 min proof at RT, then in the fridge overnight

The dough didn't seem to wet, maybe because the koji absorbs a lot of water so the 300 g in the porridge doesn't really contribute to hydration in the way that you'd expect.

The Tartine recipe calls for boiling the koji, which I did. I realized this will inactivate the enzymes in the koji, so you won't get much in the way of sweet or savory flavors other than what's already in it. I think it is a good idea to inactivate the koji, because otherwise it might break down gluten while rising. Next time I should let the koji sit in 140¬∞F water for some time, then boil.
